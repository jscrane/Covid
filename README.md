## Covid-19 in Ireland

Data is entered manually from [gov.ie](https://www.gov.ie/en/news/7e0924-latest-updates-on-covid-19-coronavirus/) and wrangled using [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/).

There is also a nice online [API](https://covid19api.com/) which I might
look into. This uses public data from Johns Hopkins so is presumably kosher. 
(However it seems, rather incredibly, that Johns Hopkins get the relevant 
data from the Irish public broadcaster RTE.)

See [github.io](https://jscrane.github.io/Covid/) for browsable version.
